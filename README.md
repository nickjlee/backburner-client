## Introduction

**Backburner** is a task management service that offers motivation to complete each task.

The application allows users to add and organize their tasks, complete them, gain experience points to level up their user profile, and earn self-described rewards as they complete each task.

Many generate a to-do list, but fail to follow through on completing those tasks...

**BackBurner** aims to allow each user to organize their tasks and motivate themselves to follow through.
